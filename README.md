## About

TaskFlow is a sleek, responsive web application built with React (and possibly TypeScript) to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. Think of it like a smart to-do list with AI-powered features that streamline your workflow.

## Features

* **Task CRUD** â€“ Create, read, update, and delete tasks with ease.
* **Progress Tracking** â€“ Mark tasks as done, view status at a glance.
* **Responsive UI** â€“ Works smoothly across devices, desktop to mobile.
* **AIâ€‘Assisted Productivity** â€“ (Assuming from name)â€”might suggest task priorities or breakdowns.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**

  * React (Create React App/Vite)
  * Tailwind CSS (as inferred from similar projects using it)
* **Backend (optional)**

  * May employ Node.js + Express + MongoDB (observed in comparable repos like rishabhgokhe/TaskFlow) ([github.com][1], [github.com][2])

*(Adjust if youâ€™ve gone with pure frontend or added more features.)*
